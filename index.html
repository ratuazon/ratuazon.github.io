<h2>About:</h2>
<p>Hi! I'm not really an interesting person. I'm an introvert, so I'm pretty much locked up inside my room 25 hours a day (Just kidding). I love watching movies, foreign TV series, and other stuff you can find around the internet. I can say that my bestfriend is probably my laptop. He knows about me more than anyone.</p>
<p>I'm a member of the University of the Philippines Mindorenos for more than two (2) years now. When I'm not with my laptop, I'm with them. They're the reason I'm able to survive the sweet torture UP provide.</p>

<h3>Expectations:</h3>
<p>Upon taking up CMSC 100, I expect that I will learn more about the web, how it works, and how to create websites. I really hope that my instructor will help me be knowledgeable in this course and will take care of me and my labmates.</p>
<p>This is my first time to take CMSC 100 even though I'm a Batch 12 student since I stopped going to the university from second semester of A.Y. 2014-2015 upto last semester due to personal reasons.</p>
